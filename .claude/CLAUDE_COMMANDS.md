# Quick Commands for Claude Code

## Git Commit
When you want me to commit changes, just say:
- "commit" or "git commit" or "do commit"

I will automatically:
1. Check git status and diff
2. Create a descriptive commit message based on the changes
3. Add all files and commit with proper formatting
4. Include Claude Code attribution footer

### Code Quality
