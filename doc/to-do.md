- when we have record created for 'API' Transaction with 'sucesss' status, create next Transaction as 'CALL' and status will be  'Waiting' by default, and all other value as empty, ex. start time yet. Score, Run By
so we know next CALL is waiting
and make sure after create refresh automacially data so user can see the change

let us do some similar process for 'API' also, once we create patient, create 'API' transaction by default status as 'Waiting' and if we start API Verification call then update status just as we do now.
now when we updated  'API' Transaction with 'sucesss' status create next Transaction as 'CALL' and status will be  'Waiting' by default, and all other value as empty, ex. start time yet. Score, Run By
so we know next CALL is waiting
